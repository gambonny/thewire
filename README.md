# The Wire – A Monorepo Template for Scalable React Apps (wip)

**The Wire** is a structured, scalable monorepo setup for React applications, designed for performance, maintainability, and developer efficiency.  

## What’s Inside  

- **PandaCSS for Atomic Styling** – A design system powered by PandaCSS with predefined tokens, utilities, and recipes.  
- **Optimized Developer Experience** – Uses Wireit for efficient script execution, ESLint & Prettier for code quality, and Vitest for testing.  
- **Vite + SWC for Performance** – A fast, optimized build pipeline for React.  
- **Strict TypeScript Configuration** – Enforcing maintainability and type safety.  
- **PNPM Workspaces & Catalogs** – Efficient dependency management and modular package organization.  
- **Volta for Environment Consistency** – Ensures all developers use the same Node.js and package manager versions.
